# WayFarer

As I was embarking on developing RESTful APIs using Spring Boot, I adhered to the following 
guidelines to ensure my project is well-structured, secure, and aligns with best practices:  
1. Implemention Security with JSON Web Tokens (JWT):  
  ○ Use Spring Security to implement authentication and authorization in your 
application.  
  ○ Ensuring JWT tokens are generated and validated securely to protect sensitive 
resources.  
  ○ Using access tokens for stateless communication between clients and the server. 
2. Password Encryption:  
  ○ Always encrypted passwords before storing them in the database.  
3. Project Structure and Packages:  
  ○ Organized my application into well-defined packages for clarity and maintainability. At a minimum, include:  
    ■ controllers: Handle HTTP requests and responses.  
    ■ entities: Represent database tables as Java objects.  
    ■ services: contain business logic.  
    ■ repositories: Interact with the database.  
    ■ payloads: Define request and response data objects.  
    ■ utils: Define utility classes.  
4. Using appropriate HTTP status codes:  
  ○ Return meaningful status codes for API responses.  
5. API Versioning:  
  ○ Incorporate API versioning to ensure backward compatibility as your application evolves.  
  ○ Use URI versioning (e.g., /api/v1/resource) or other strategies discussed in class.
